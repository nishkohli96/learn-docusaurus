# More About Docusaurus Info

Some of the points below are directly from the [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) website, while others are observations of my playing around with the starter project, after reading almost all of the documents.

- Pages do not have sidebars, only docs do.
- `@site/` is the alias to import stuff from top level of the project directory.
- Syntax to add metadata is added to the `.md` in the beginning..

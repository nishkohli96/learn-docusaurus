# MDX - More Info

You can also import your own components defined in other files or third-party components installed via npm.

```
<!-- External component -->
import Button from '@mui/material/Button';
```

As per my testing, this import worked fine in _src/pages_ directory but failed in _docs_ directory.

By convention, using the `_` filename prefix will not create any doc page and means the Markdown file is a "partial", to be imported by other files.
